Using with React.createElement and creating element with this way is a part of core react.
But using this way it makes our code very complex.
So we avoid this way.
Instead of this we use JSX.

Can we write code without JSX?
Yes, By using React.createElement.
But this makes our code very complex so we don't write using it.
But this is core react.
And JSX makes our life easy.
